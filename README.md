## About this

One of my biggest hobbies is music. In this project, you have a fully responsive web application on any device that allows you to create an account and archive your collections and favorites of all those items you like.

You can search for songs, artists, albums, EPs, and much more, plus you have information at hand about each of them.
One of my biggest hobbies is music, in this project you have a fully responsive web application for use on any device that allows you to create an account and archive in your collections and favorites all those items that you like.

## How does it work?

We are connecting the application to a database managed by Firebase to save your user and all the information you want to add. Likewise, the Frontend is completely developed in React with Sass. Redux was used for state management and React Router for routing.

## How to install it?

First you must have a compatible version of node: v14.x
And be able to run node based programs in the classic way, if you are using an Apple Silicon you should run the terminal and the Node installation in Rosetta.

Then copy and install this repository with ```npm i```

You must generate your credentials keys to the Firebase and Discogs APIs to be able to attach them to an .env.


## All that makes you a bit lazy?

You can test live the application [here](https://tone-desk.vercel.app/).
