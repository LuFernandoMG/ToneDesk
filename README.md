## About this

ToneDesk is a project that sought to meet the code challenge posed by Bridge For Billions, it required a music search engine through the Discogs API, however, it is rethought as an application integrated with Firebase and Firestore to keep a personal record of your music collection and also save all those records that you have in mind to acquire soon.

### What can you do?

Start now by creating your user and entering the platform, where you can search for Labels, Artists, Masters or Releases that you have in your own collection or that you are looking to acquire.

Discover new information about what you were looking for and add it to your personal collection to keep track of it, or include it in your wish list to know what will be your next acquisition.

Check in the navigation menu your private collection and your wish list.

### How it was built?

We start from a classic Create-React-App, which is supported by Firebase to handle authentication and a database, is connected to Discogs to get the information and uses Redux to manage the global status (and request statuses).

In addition, it uses Sass to handle stylesheets, Git for version management and Github along with Netlify to store and publish the application.
